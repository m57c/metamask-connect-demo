# Login with MetaMask Demo
This app demonstrates a typical login with MetaMask flow.

The code is deployed here to try out: https://m57c.github.io/metamask-connect-demo/

The flow has 4 steps:

1. Detect the Ethereum provider
2. Detect the network the user is connected to
3. Get the user's account id
4. Request a signature to prove ownership of the account

## Development

To run the development server and build the JS with Parcel and the CSS with tailwind:
```bash
npm run dev
```
